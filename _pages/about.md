I am a fourth-year PhD candidate at EEE, NTU in Singapore, supervised by Prof. Lihua Xie. I am also a research associate at the Centre for Advanced Robotics Technology Innovation (CARTIN). Before that, I obtained my bachelor (2019) and master (2021) degree from Wuhan University and NTU, respectively.

My research mainly focuses on **efficient 3D semantic segmentation** and **video-based action recognition**. I am interested in improving perception systems with trivial human annotations in both online and offline manners. I am also glad to work with my colleagues to leverage semantic understanding in different tasks.
