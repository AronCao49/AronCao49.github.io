I am currently a Project Academic Specialist (Project Assistant Professor upon PhD conferral) in Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology, University of Tokyo, under the supervision of Prof. Tatsuya Harada. I conducted my PhD study at EEE, NTU in Singapore, supervised by Prof. Lihua Xie. I was also a research associate at the Centre for Advanced Robotics Technology Innovation (CARTIN). Before that, I obtained my bachelor (2019) and master (2021) degree from Wuhan University and NTU, respectively.

My research mainly focuses on **efficient multi-modal 3D perception** and **video-based action recognition**. I am interested in improving perception systems with trivial human annotations in both online and offline manners. I am also glad to work with my colleagues to leverage semantic understanding in different tasks.
